Expected for v0.2.0:
- Test suite
- Allow to read VMFS even when not having all extents

Expected for v0.3.0:
- Improve test suite
- Make debugvmfs more of a VMFS debugging tool and less of a vmfs-tools testing tool
- fsck.vmfs

Expected for v0.5.0:
- Stable internal API
- mkfs.vmfs

Expected for v1.0.0:
- Full write support.

Any time:
- Check if we want to read/update separately metadata header from the metadata
  itself (for example: vmfs_inode_read/vmfs_inode_write)
- Add locking/unlocking/update functions for metadata headers
- Improve build system and portability
