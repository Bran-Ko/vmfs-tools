vmfs-tools - Tools to access VMFS filesystems
=============================================

Originally loosely based on http://code.google.com/p/vmfs/ from fluidOps,
this set of tools has since evolved to handle more features from VMFS, such
as extents, and allows to access VMFS through the standard Linux VFS with
the help of the FUSE framework.

While it is still work in progress and is not destined for production use
yet, it can be of some help for some people.
